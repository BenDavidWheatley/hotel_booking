          <h1>About Hotel Gorgoroth</h1>
          <p>Complety inhospitable, the arid plateau that is Gorgoroth is situated at the core of Sauron's realm.          
          Located at its centre is the active volcano known as Mount Doom, a three day trek from the hotel.         
          Towards the north of Gorgoroth you can find the Ash mountains and the fortress that is Barad-d√ªr, where the ever watching eye of Sauron can be found.
          Should you wish to venture further a field, you could always jump on a Drake and fly to Nurn just south of Mordor or out to the deserts of Lithlad towrds the east.
